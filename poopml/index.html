		<p><strong>PoopML</strong> is both a content and structure expression standard. It originates in work on the Feces Expression Content and Arrangement Language (FECAL).</p>
		<p>A PoopML implementation should encourage well-formed representations whenever possible. However, due to the flexibility of PoopML, you may have provide a structured framework for parsing.</p>
		<p>The primary element set, which follows below, is also referred to as "Dublin Corn".</p>
		<h2>Primary element set</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>&lt;poop&gt; - the root element</li>
			<li>&lt;size&gt;</li>
			<li>&lt;shape&gt;</li>
			<li>&lt;smell&gt;</li>
